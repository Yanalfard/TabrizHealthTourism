                                        The word Cardiovascular disease is usually used to refer to a heart attack. However, other Cardiovascular disease include coronary artery disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy. Below we will explain these Cardiovascular disease and their symptoms.
                                         heart attack:<br />
                                        A heart attack or stroke occurs when one of the coronary arteries (usually by a blood clot) gets closed. This attack causes a shortage or lack of blood in part of the heart. Lack of blood can cause the end of that part of the heart. It is one of the most common types of Cardiovascular disease in the United States, with about one million heart attacks for each year.<br />
                                        Most people with a heart attack usually have one or two symptoms of chest pain, back pain, hands, neck, jaw, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, rapid or irregular heartbeat, fatigue, anxiety, indigestion, or gastric burn. Heart symptoms in some women may be different from those of men, which can include gastric irritation, irregular heartbeat, frustration, or loss of appetite. Ignoring the symptoms of Cardiovascular disease can delay treatment, resulting in further damage to heart tissue or even resulting in death. If you have a heart attack, call the emergency room immediately and do not try to attend to  a doctor's office or a hospital yourself since emergency personnel can apply early treatments.<br />
                                        Coronary artery disease:<br />
                                        Coronary arteries deliver food, oxygen and blood to the heart muscle. They usually get sick or injured due to cholesterol build up which takes place in them.<br />
                                        These cholesterol layers make the blood vessels thinner, resulting in insufficient blood and oxygen supply transfer to the heart. Coronary artery disease can increase chance of heart attack.<br />
                                        Heart arrhythmia:
                                        Arrhythmias mean problems with the rhythm and irregularity of the heartbeat. It occurs when pulses regulate heart rate and do not function properly. Types of Arrhythmia or Irregular Heartbeat Expressions include:<br />
                                        Tachycardia: when heart beats very fast.<br />
                                        Bradycardia: when heart beats very slowly.<br />
                                        Fibrillation: When the heartbeat is irregular.<br />
                                        Irregular heartbeat is common and most of us have experienced it. But if the pulse rate is very much different from the usual pulse or due to injury or heart failure, it should be taken seriously. You should see a doctor immediately when irregular palpation is prolonged or causes chest pain.<br />
                                        cardiomyopathy<br />
                                        It causes changes in the heart muscle, which reduces the ability of the heart to pump blood. Other conditions, including hypertension or heart valve disease, also occur with cardiomyopathy.<br />
                                        heart faliure<br />
                                        Heart failure, also called congestive heart failure, occurs when the heart is unable to effectively pump blood through the body. It affects the left, right, or both sides of the body. Hypertension or coronary artery disease can cause this sickness.<br />
                                        congenital heart defect<br />
                                        In England, about one in every 1,000 children has this disease. One of the congenital heart defects is called a hole in the heart. There is a hole in the ventricles of the heart. This condition causes the blood supply to the heart's atria to become slightly small or completely closed and insufficient oxygen is being pumped into the body.<br />
                                        Mitral regurgitation<br />
                                        This condition is also known as mitral insufficiency. It occurs when the mitral valve of the heart is not properly closed and causes the blood to return to heart. Blood in people with mitral valve failure is not well distributed in the body and makes him feel having short of breath and also tired.<br />
                                        Angina<br />
                                        Angina, also known as angina pectoris, which causes insufficient oxygen to reach the heart. Although not technically considered a disease in itself, it is one of the hallmarks of coronary artery disease because of a lack of oxygen due to coronary artery occlusion.<br />
                                         who are the people with high risk of getting heart diseases?<br />
                                        1. High blood cholesterol<br />
                                        2. Hypertension<br />
                                        3. Diabetes<br />
                                        4. Low physical activity<br />
                                        Ways to Prevent Heart Disease<br />
                                        1. Not smoking<br />
                                        2. Avoid drinking alcohol<br />
                                        3. Control diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol<br />

                                The word Cardiovascular disease is usually used to refer to a heart attack. However, other Cardiovascular disease include coronary artery disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy. Below we will explain these Cardiovascular disease and their symptoms.
                                         heart attack:<br />
                                        A heart attack or stroke occurs when one of the coronary arteries (usually by a blood clot) gets closed. This attack causes a shortage or lack of blood in part of the heart. Lack of blood can cause the end of that part of the heart. It is one of the most common types of Cardiovascular disease in the United States, with about one million heart attacks for each year.<br />
                                        Most people with a heart attack usually have one or two symptoms of chest pain, back pain, hands, neck, jaw, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, rapid or irregular heartbeat, fatigue, anxiety, indigestion, or gastric burn. Heart symptoms in some women may be different from those of men, which can include gastric irritation, irregular heartbeat, frustration, or loss of appetite. Ignoring the symptoms of Cardiovascular disease can delay treatment, resulting in further damage to heart tissue or even resulting in death. If you have a heart attack, call the emergency room immediately and do not try to attend to  a doctor's office or a hospital yourself since emergency personnel can apply early treatments.<br />
                                        Coronary artery disease:<br />
                                        Coronary arteries deliver food, oxygen and blood to the heart muscle. They usually get sick or injured due to cholesterol build up which takes place in them.<br />
                                        These cholesterol layers make the blood vessels thinner, resulting in insufficient blood and oxygen supply transfer to the heart. Coronary artery disease can increase chance of heart attack.<br />
                                        Heart arrhythmia:
                                        Arrhythmias mean problems with the rhythm and irregularity of the heartbeat. It occurs when pulses regulate heart rate and do not function properly. Types of Arrhythmia or Irregular Heartbeat Expressions include:<br />
                                        Tachycardia: when heart beats very fast.<br />
                                        Bradycardia: when heart beats very slowly.<br />
                                        Fibrillation: When the heartbeat is irregular.<br />
                                        Irregular heartbeat is common and most of us have experienced it. But if the pulse rate is very much different from the usual pulse or due to injury or heart failure, it should be taken seriously. You should see a doctor immediately when irregular palpation is prolonged or causes chest pain.<br />
                                        cardiomyopathy<br />
                                        It causes changes in the heart muscle, which reduces the ability of the heart to pump blood. Other conditions, including hypertension or heart valve disease, also occur with cardiomyopathy.<br />
                                        heart faliure<br />
                                        Heart failure, also called congestive heart failure, occurs when the heart is unable to effectively pump blood through the body. It affects the left, right, or both sides of the body. Hypertension or coronary artery disease can cause this sickness.<br />
                                        congenital heart defect<br />
                                        In England, about one in every 1,000 children has this disease. One of the congenital heart defects is called a hole in the heart. There is a hole in the ventricles of the heart. This condition causes the blood supply to the heart's atria to become slightly small or completely closed and insufficient oxygen is being pumped into the body.<br />
                                        Mitral regurgitation<br />
                                        This condition is also known as mitral insufficiency. It occurs when the mitral valve of the heart is not properly closed and causes the blood to return to heart. Blood in people with mitral valve failure is not well distributed in the body and makes him feel having short of breath and also tired.<br />
                                        Angina<br />
                                        Angina, also known as angina pectoris, which causes insufficient oxygen to reach the heart. Although not technically considered a disease in itself, it is one of the hallmarks of coronary artery disease because of a lack of oxygen due to coronary artery occlusion.<br />
                                         who are the people with high risk of getting heart diseases?<br />
                                        1. High blood cholesterol<br />
                                        2. Hypertension<br />
                                        3. Diabetes<br />
                                        4. Low physical activity<br />
                                        Ways to Prevent Heart Disease<br />
                                        1. Not smoking<br />
                                        2. Avoid drinking alcohol<br />
                                        3. Control diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol<br />

This attack causes a shortage or lack of blood in part of the heart. Lack of blood can cause the end of that part of the heart. It is one of the most common types of Cardiovascular disease in the United States, with about one million heart attacks for each year.<br />
                                        Most people with a heart attack usually have one or two symptoms of chest pain, back pain, hands, neck, jaw, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, rapid or irregular heartbeat, fatigue, anxiety, indigestion, or gastric burn. Heart symptoms in some women may be different from those of men, which can include gastric irritation, irregular heartbeat, frustration, or loss of appetite. Ignoring the symptoms of Cardiovascular disease can delay treatment, resulting in further damage to heart tissue or even resulting in death. If you have a heart attack, call the emergency room immediately and do not try to attend to  a doctor's office or a hospital yourself since emergency personnel can apply early treatments.<br />
                                        Coronary artery disease:<br />
                                        Coronary arteries deliver food, oxygen and blood to the heart muscle. They usually get sick or injured due to cholesterol build up which takes place in them.<br />
                                        These cholesterol layers make the blood vessels thinner, resulting in insufficient blood and oxygen supply transfer to the heart. Coronary artery disease can increase chance of heart attack.<br />
                                        Heart arrhythmia:
                                        Arrhythmias mean problems with the rhythm and irregularity of the heartbeat. It occurs when pulses regulate heart rate and do not function properly. Types of Arrhythmia or Irregular Heartbeat Expressions include:<br />
                                        Tachycardia: when heart beats very fast.<br />
                                        Bradycardia: when heart beats very slowly.<br />
                                        Fibrillation: When the heartbeat is irregular.<br />
                                        Irregular heartbeat is common and most of us have experienced it. But if the pulse rate is very much different from the usual pulse or due to injury or heart failure, it should be taken seriously. You should see a doctor immediately when irregular palpation is prolonged or causes chest pain.<br />
                                        cardiomyopathy<br />
                                        It causes changes in the heart muscle, which reduces the ability of the heart to pump blood. Other conditions, including hypertension or heart valve disease, also occur with cardiomyopathy.<br />
                                        heart faliure<br />
                                        Heart failure, also called congestive heart failure, occurs when the heart is unable to effectively pump blood through the body. It affects the left, right, or both sides of the body. Hypertension or coronary artery disease can cause this sickness.<br />
                                        congenital heart defect<br />
                                        In England, about one in every 1,000 children has this disease. One of the congenital heart defects is called a hole in the heart. There is a hole in the ventricles of the heart. This condition causes the blood supply to the heart's atria to become slightly small or completely closed and insufficient oxygen is being pumped into the body.<br />
                                        Mitral regurgitation<br />
                                        This condition is also known as mitral insufficiency. It occurs when the mitral valve of the heart is not properly closed and causes the blood to return to heart. Blood in people with mitral valve failure is not well distributed in the body and makes him feel having short of breath and also tired.<br />
                                        Angina<br />
                                        Angina, also known as angina pectoris, which causes insufficient oxygen to reach the heart. Although not technically considered a disease in itself, it is one of the hallmarks of coronary artery disease because of a lack of oxygen due to coronary artery occlusion.<br />
